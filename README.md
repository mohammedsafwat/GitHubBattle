# GitHubBattle

A small battle game between GitHub users implemented with React. 
The idea is to calculate a score for every user based on his number of repos, his stars and his followers.

This project is built following one of [Tyler MccGinnis'](https://tylermcginnis.com) React courses. 

# How to run the app

Clone the repo, and then inside your root directory run: `npm run dev`.

# Live demo
